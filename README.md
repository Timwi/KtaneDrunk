# "Go Home - You're Drunk" - a KTANEModKit module

## Blurb
You've been out partying all night, and you're pretty much wasted. You struggle back home, but then you get the call to defuse a bomb.

Get yourself your tried-and-tested remedy for your drunken haze, and hope that the hangover doesn't set in too soon.

## Info
This module will cause the camera to slowly list and tilt around, trying to make you feel like you're really drunk while trying to defuse the bomb.

## VR Users
I have no idea if this mod will work for you as I don't have a VR headset, and I'm modifying the camera's transform per-update, which would happen by the VR's SDK as well. If you do try it out, please let me know what happens. If it's really nauseating, definitely let me know.

Since this module will be affecting your visual perspective, those playing on VR headsets may experience balance issues, etc, so be extra careful. You have been warned!

Template is an experimental module leveraging the newly-exposed KTANEModKit for 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes'.

## Installation

### Steam Workshop Installation

If you purchased _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_ through Steam, you'll be able to subscribe to the mod on the Steam Workshop.

Firstly, ensure that you are on the modpreview Beta of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes; to do this, in Steam, right click on the game and go to Properties, then go to the Betas tab, and in the drop-down, select __modpreview__. If all went well, you should be updating to the preview version, and once downloaded, the game's name should now have __[modpreview]__ on the end of it.

Next, join the KTANEMod Beta community group on Steam by going to http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ktanemodbeta

Finally, goto http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725245006 to subscribe to the Semaphore mod. This will download the module automatically for you, and will continue to download updates for the module when updates are released.

### Non-Steam Installation

If you didn't purchase 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes' through Steam, but you have a modpreview version to play on, then you can manually install the module instead of using the Steam Workshop.

Goto https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-drunk/releases and download the latest release for the module.

Inside the *.zip file will be a folder called Drunk; drop that folder into the `<path>/<to>/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/mods` folder. (If the folder doesn't exist, create one for it).
