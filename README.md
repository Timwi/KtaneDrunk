# "Go Home - You're Drunk" - a KTANEModKit module

## Blurb
You've been out partying all night, and you're pretty much wasted. You struggle back home, but then you get the call to defuse a bomb.

Get yourself your tried-and-tested remedy for your drunken haze, and hope that the hangover doesn't set in too soon.

## Info
This module will cause the camera to slowly list and tilt around, trying to make you feel like you're really drunk while trying to defuse the bomb.

## VR Users
According to bitstim, this mod will have no effect on VR users, as the VR headset positioning overrides all other camera positioning techniques.

## Installation

### Steam Workshop Installation

If you purchased _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_ through Steam, you'll be able to subscribe to the mod on the Steam Workshop; goto http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725245006 to subscribe to the Drunk mod. This will download the module automatically for you, and will continue to download updates for the module when updates are released.

### Non-Steam Installation

If you didn't purchase _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_ through Steam, but you have a mod-enabled version to play on, then you can manually install the module instead of using the Steam Workshop.

Goto https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-drunk/releases and download the latest release for the module.

Inside the *.zip file will be a folder called Drunk; drop that folder into the `<path>/<to>/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/mods` folder. (If the folder doesn't exist, create one for it).
